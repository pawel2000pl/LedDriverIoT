<p>
    The WiFi and Bluetooth functionalities of your LED RGB controller come with the option to enable a "white-list" of
    MAC addresses. This feature allows you to specify which devices are permitted to connect to your controller,
    enhancing security and control over network access.
</p>

<p>
    A white-list is a list of approved MAC addresses, which are unique identifiers assigned to each network device. By
    enabling the white-list feature, only devices whose MAC addresses are included on this list will be allowed to
    establish connections with your LED RGB controller. Any device not on the list will be denied access, providing a
    safeguard against unauthorized access.
</p>

<p>
    Functionality Overview:
</p>

<p>
    1. Enabling White-List: Users can activate the white-list feature for both WiFi and Bluetooth connections. Once
    enabled, only devices whose MAC addresses are on the list will be able to connect.
</p>
<p>
    2. Managing White-List: Users have the flexibility to add or remove MAC addresses from the white-list as needed,
    allowing for easy customization of allowed devices.
</p>
<p>
    3. Recent MAC Addresses: Additionally, users will have visibility of a list containing the MAC addresses of the last
    few devices that connected to the controller. This feature provides users with quick access to the MAC addresses
    they may wish to add to the white-list.
</p>
<p>
    By leveraging the white-list feature, users can ensure that only trusted devices are permitted to connect to their
    LED RGB controller, enhancing security and control over network access.
