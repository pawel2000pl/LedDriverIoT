        The LED RGB controller you are working on incorporates a feature called "filters," allowing you to adjust the input
        and output curves for optimal performance. This feature is particularly useful due to two main factors:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Human Perception of Brightness: Human vision perceives brightness on a logarithmic scale rather than a linear
        one. As a result, a linear increase in input (like turning a knob) may not translate into a perceived linear
        increase in brightness. Filters help adjust the input curve to match human perception, ensuring smoother and more
        intuitive control over brightness levels.

        2. LED Characteristics: Different LED diodes can have varying brightness characteristics. Some LEDs may require more
        power to achieve the same perceived brightness as others. Filters enable you to tailor the output curve to match the
        characteristics of the specific LEDs you are using, ensuring consistent and accurate brightness control across
        different diodes.

        By combining several predefined functions, these filters allow you to customize the input curve from potentiometers
        and the output curve to the LED control transistors. This customization helps achieve the desired brightness levels
        effectively, accounting for both human perception and LED characteristics.

        Below this explanation, you will find illustrations of the various functions available for creating combinations to
        tailor the curves according to your specific requirements.
