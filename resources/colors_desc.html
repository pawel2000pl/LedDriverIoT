    RGB (Red, Green, Blue): This color space represents colors as combinations of red, green, and blue light. Each color
    channel can have values ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 means no intensity and 1 means full intensity. It's commonly
    used in digital displays and image processing.

    HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value): HSV represents colors based on their hue, saturation, and value. Hue refers to the
    type of color (e.g., red, blue), saturation represents the intensity or purity of the color, and value represents
    the brightness of the color. It's often used in graphic design and image editing for its intuitive representation of
    color.

    HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness): Similar to HSV, HSL also represents colors based on hue, saturation, and
    lightness. However, in HSL, lightness replaces value, and it represents the perceived brightness of the color.
    Lightness ranges from 0% (black) to 100% (white), while hue and saturation remain the same as in HSV. HSL is popular
    for its simplicity and ease of use in web design and CSS styling.
