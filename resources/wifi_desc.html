    The WiFi connection feature of your LED RGB controller operates on a prioritized list basis.
</p>
<p>
    1. Adding Networks: Users can add entries to the list containing the name of the network and its password.
</p>
<p>
    2. Connection Priority: When the device searches for available networks, it tries to connect to the first network on
    the list. If a connection is not established, it moves to the next network on the list, following the priority
    order.
</p>
<p>
    3. Fallback Option: If none of the networks on the list are found, the device creates its own network (access point)
    with the specified name and password below the list. However, if the access point is disabled, it won't create a
    new netwodk and will instead resume searching after a certain period.
</p>
<p>
    4. Repetition of Algorithm: The device repeats this algorithm each time it fails to establish a connection with a
    network. If it enters access point mode, it does so only after a restart or manual selection of a network from the
    list (via the "connect" button).
</p>
<p>
    This approach ensures seamless connectivity by attempting to connect to preferred networks first, with a fallback
    option to create its own network if necessary.
</p>
<p>
    Users can manage network priorities and configurations efficiently through the provided interface, ensuring reliable
    and user-friendly WiFi connectivity for the LED RGB controller.
