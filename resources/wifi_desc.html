<p>
    Hostname and MDNS
</p>
<p>
    Hostname is used for finding this device on a device list in your router.
    You can also use mDNS to discover the IP address of this driver. 
    One example of an application that supports mDNS discovery is the "mDNS Discovery" app, available for Android.
    Afetr installing the application, open it and search for "http" or "https" service type. 
    Ensure that there is checked "TCP" below the search bar. 
    That is everything that you need to find all led drivers available in the same network as your phone.
    Once you see the driver in the list, long-press it to open the driver's web panel in your default browser.
    If you do not see the led driver, ensure check if the driver is connected to the same network as your phone.
    Some systems might also detect IP of the driver when you enter <i>hostname</i>.local into an address bar of a browser, 
    f.e.: <a href="http://led-driver.local">led-driver.local</a>.

<p>
    The WiFi connection feature of your LED RGB controller operates on a prioritized list basis.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Adding Networks: Users can add entries to the list containing the name of the network and its password.
    </li>
    <li>
        Connection Priority: When the device searches for available networks, it tries to connect to the first
        network on the list. If a connection is not established, it moves to the next network on the list, following the
        priority order.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fallback Option: If none of the networks on the list are found, the device creates its own network (access
        point) with the specified name and password below the list. However, if the access point is disabled, it won't
        create a new network and will instead resume searching after a certain period.
    </li>
    <li>
        Repetition of Algorithm: The device repeats this algorithm each time it fails to establish a connection with
        a network. If it enters access point mode, it does so only after a restart or manual selection of a network from
        the list (via the "connect" button).
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    This approach ensures seamless connectivity by attempting to connect to preferred networks first, with a fallback
    option to create its own network if necessary.
</p>
<p>
    Users can manage network priorities and configurations efficiently through the provided interface, ensuring reliable
    and user-friendly WiFi connectivity for the LED RGB controller.
</p>
<p>
    Users have the option to configure an access point with specific parameters. Here's how it works:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        SSID and Password: These fields allow users to define the name and password for the network that will be
        created. The password must consist of 8 to 63 characters or be left empty for an open network.
    </li>
    <li>
        The channel selection feature allows you to specify which Wi-Fi channel the device should use for communication.
        Wi-Fi networks operate on different channels within the 2.4 GHz band, and selecting the right channel can help
        avoid interference from other nearby networks and devices, improving performance and reliability.
        When manually selecting a channel, it's advisable to choose one of the non-overlapping channels: 1, 6, or 11.
        These channels minimize interference with each other and are widely recommended for stable Wi-Fi communication
        in crowded environments.
        It is generally recommended to avoid channels between 2 and 5 or between 7 and 10, as these overlap with other
        channels, leading to increased interference and degraded performance.
        If you set the channel to 0, the device will automatically scan the environment and choose the least congested
        channel from the set of channels 1, 6, or 11. This is useful in environments where the Wi-Fi spectrum is
        crowded, and manually selecting a channel may be less effective.
    </li>
    <li>
        Address, Gateway, and Subnet: Address refers to the IPv4 address where the device's web panel can be accessed
        through a web browser. Gateway and Subnet are network-related settings.
    </li>
    <li>
        Gateway: This is the IP address of the router or access point that connects the device to the broader network,
        typically the Internet. It serves as the entry point for network traffic going outside the local network.
    </li>
    <li>
        Subnet: Subnet defines the range of IP addresses that devices on the local network can use. It determines the
        size of the network and helps in routing traffic between devices within the network.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It's recommended that users avoid changing the default settings for Address, Gateway, and Subnet unless they fully
    understand their implications. Altering these settings without proper knowledge may lead to network connectivity
    issues.
</p>
<p>
    Dependencies between Address, Gateway, and Subnet:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Address: Must be within the same subnet range as the Gateway to ensure proper communication between devices on
        the local network.
    </li>
    <li>
        Gateway: Should be the same as the router's IP address within the network to ensure connectivity to the broader
        network, such as the Internet.
    </li>
    <li>
        Subnet: Must be consistent across devices within the same network to facilitate communication and data exchange.
        Changing the subnet may result in devices being unable to communicate with each other.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    By adhering to these guidelines and understanding the dependencies between Address, Gateway, and Subnet, users can
    effectively configure the access point for their LED RGB controller while maintaining network stability and
    functionality.
